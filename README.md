#### A little about this project:
This project is a personal website. I first created this website last spring with no experience in JS/React and have continued editing as I've learned more about the languages. I wanted to create a website that could also serve as a professional portfolio, so I included sections to highlight my experiences and coding projects. I have learned so much about building interfaces and handling user interaction through this project and gained experience utilizing different component and plugins. I'm hoping to add more animation to the website in the future!
