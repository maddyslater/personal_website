# Personal Website

## Description :
This project is a personal website. As I move deeper into the software-developing realm, I wanted to put together a website that displays both some of my credentials as well as my passopm for coding. I split the website into three sections: about, experience, and contact. This was my first time coding in both Javascript and React. It was challenging, yet fun, to explore the lamguages as I progressed! I tried to challenge myself to utilize as many different components and packages as I could to expand my knowledge base as much as possible.

## Instructions :
To run locally, `cd` into the directory and pass `npm run dev` to the terminal
